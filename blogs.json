The aim of the analysis was to answer these questions:</p>\n<blockquote><strong><em>What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices\u00a0spike?</em></strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong><em>What is the most expensive neighbourhood?</em></strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong><em>Do hosts with higher rating have higher\u00a0revenue?</em></strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong><em>Which amenities of the house contribute more to the\u00a0price?</em></strong></blockquote>\n<p>The dataset is made by three CSV\u00a0files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Calendar, </strong>including listing id and the price and availability for that\u00a0day</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Listings</strong>, including full descriptions and average review\u00a0score</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reviews</strong>, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed\u00a0comments</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><em>What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?

As we can see from the plot below, <strong>January </strong>seem<strong> </strong>to be absolutely the month with <strong>low availability percentage c</strong>ompared to the other,<strong> with about only the 50% of the houses available. </strong>There seem to be also a little drop of availability on April and July. On the other hand, <strong>in December the houses are likely all available (about 81% of\u00a0them).</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*twGL0n_ZZ_POpBdPiMabUw.png\"></figure><h4>And about the\u00a0price?</h4>\n<p>The plot below shows the moving of the mean price in the listings per month. In there we can found what it appears to be a strange correlation between the price and the availability, with both of them moving together. Particularly, <strong>in</strong> <strong>January</strong> (which we have found has the small availability percentage) <strong>the mean price of the properties is the lowest of the year. </strong>The maximum price of the year is found in July/August, where the availability seem to have a discrete\u00a0drop.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*msgpASyMOtREqZIxO38R9A.png\"></figure><h3><strong><em>What is the most expensive neighbourhood?</em></strong></h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*BrX0MhgfPueigsy1JushlA.jpeg\"></figure><p>The question I chose is based on a hypothetical new user who wants to invest in a property in the city and maximize its revenue when listing the property on Airbnb. While this analysis is quite easy, can answer the question in a great way and assure the future property holder that the position of the house will boost its\u00a0income.</p>\n<p>In the plot below we see that <strong>Fairmount park is</strong> <strong>the most expensive neighbourhood</strong>, with an average price of <strong>350$ per night</strong>, followed by the Industrial district and Portage Bay (both around\u00a0250$).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KPs-mSZesoigguP8NeCLCw.png\"></figure><p>Similarly to the most expensive neighbourhood, I decided to plot the less expensive ones. The results say that <strong>Roxhill and Olympic Hills</strong> <strong>are the cheapest place to stay</strong> (with relative prices of around <strong>60/65$ per\u00a0night</strong>).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rStqd4v3lS5tK_AvHopV0Q.png\"></figure><h3><strong><em>Which amenities of the house contribute more to the\u00a0price?</em></strong></h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IxCtS2EfYLgqECVhBfM42Q.jpeg\"></figure><p>Last but not least, one of the most important things when looking for a house apart from the position is the amenities it offers. If you have to choose between two houses at the about the same price and only one of the two offers the swimming pool, a smart TV with Netflix or maybe a dishwasher, <strong>which one would you\u00a0pick?</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes people prefer to spend more on an expensive property with more amenities instead of a cheaper one without\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>In the last analysis I performed I intend to analyze <strong>which amenities of the houses contribute more to the price</strong>. That was probably the trickiest part of the work because the amenities are often written stacked and are quite similar between them (e.g. take Wi-fi and Internet, they are the same but are written in different ways). So after a long cleaning of the data I was able to see the different amenities of the listings in different columns.
